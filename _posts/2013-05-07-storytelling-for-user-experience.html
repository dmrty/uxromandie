<p>It&rsquo;s the job of designers to make the world a more livable place, to build up relationships between brands and customers and to facilitate good experiences. Our core task is to add meaning. And it&rsquo;s Jeroen's belief that understanding storytelling is of the essence if we want to do this.</p>
<p>During this talk Jeroen takes you from traditional storytelling to our everyday life as designers. There he will show that designing a product isn&rsquo;t just about features, design principles and usability, but about facilitating the birth of new stories between people and products. With videos, images and live sketching he will create a framework where products are parter of a bigger ecosystem.</p>
