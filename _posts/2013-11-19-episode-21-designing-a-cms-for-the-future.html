<p>Designing a content management system poses a beautiful problem: How do you design a tool you don't know the future use of? In the TYPO3 Neos project, we turned to urban planning principles to look for answers. Rasmus Skjoldan will explain how to install what he calls "UX infrastructure" in your projects, letting you plan how changes can flow through your interfaces and user experience strategies. You will also learn about the Neos way of inline editing, WYSIWYG, raw and structured content - and how to tame the great problem of previewing.</p>
<p>UX Romandie invites you on December 17th to Pully CityClub movie theater. Rasmus, freshly landed from Copenhagen, will explain us the research he did to design Neos and will show us his work in its first Swiss preview.</p>
