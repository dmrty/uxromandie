<p>For march, Join us and Thomas who will tells us the story of his life in agencies and as a unique UX Designer in big corporations.</p>
<p>This talks elaborates from his personal experience of a designer between consulting work in an agency and corporate employment in the design department of corporations.<br />
With the big idea in mind that design should be able to encourage if not lead innovation, Thomas would like to take you on a journey from the basic principles of client engagement to the art of crafting corporate alliances and navigate around the minefield of big-firm-bureaucracy.<br />
He will talk about the specifics in team setup, business manners and design tools that may cross your ways from working with creative studios to multi-national design departments. And hopefully with a slight sense of humor and a little dash of sarcasm, he will give you some real-world advice on how to survive and still stay creative in all of these environments.</p>
