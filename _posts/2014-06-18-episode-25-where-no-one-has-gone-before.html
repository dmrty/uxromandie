    to put up a video online - time we don't have today.\nWe'll see what we can do
    (maybe an audio sync with the slides) but I cannot make any promise.\n\nSorry

<p>There was once a time where you would never have said that an enterprise application could be Simple or User friendly.</p>
<p>Complex systems were synonym of difficult to implement and complicated to use. In this fast changing world where building web and mobile applications is easier then ever before and simplicity the new design standard, the enterprise is far from being left behind. Not only is legacy software being replaced &nbsp;by cloud platforms but the user is becoming central in large organisations.</p>
<p>In this talk we will explore how consumer applications are currently having a huge impact on Enterprise Software and how designing for the enterprise can be the next big thing in technology.</p>
