<p>&ldquo;Storytelling" appears to be a magic word when it comes to creating user experience&mdash;we use it to evoke design ideals, to summon the creative spirit, or to cry out for a narrative link across the complex world of devices and short attention span. But is this all there is?</p>
<p>Unconvinced that storytelling could be so superficial, Steph spent a few years learning from the art of making documentaries, crime fiction, novels and the shortest of stories. As she uncovered the parallels in the making of stories and the research/design processes of UX, she began to formulate a framework where these two worlds meet, unearthing a different angle on what we do in order to take our skills to greater heights.</p>
<p>In this session, Steph will show how understanding &ldquo;story&rdquo; opens a world of possibilities and adds another dimension to your UX toolset. Better still, it&rsquo;s less of a mystery than what you might think.</p>
