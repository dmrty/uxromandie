<p>Finding the right balance between user needs, business needs and technical feasibility can sometime be challenging. This talk will discuss simple collaboration techniques you can use to make sure the voice of the user is fed into product's strategy.</p>
<p>By involving your stakeholders and team members throughout your design process, starting in its early stages, you will see them empathise more with users, and your ability to influence will increase. In addition, you&rsquo;ll create shared understanding, which will make working with your colleagues much more enjoyable and productive. Finally working together as a multidisciplinary team, you&rsquo;ll explore a greater multitude of ideas, and converge toward a better solution!</p>
