<p id="eow-description" class="">With technology becoming a commodity, the last time Andy spoke at The Next Web, he explained how user experience was the next competitive battleground. Jump forward a couple of years and every start-up worth their series B has been investing in design; whether that&rsquo;s hiring super star designers, commissioning world leading consultancies, or buying entire design studios. But how to you find the best talent, and, more importunely, how do you keep them? In this masterclass session, User Experience expert, Andy Budd, will outline the nine things you need to do to foster a healthy design culture, hire the right people, nurture talent and build a world class design team; in order to use design for your competitive advantage.</p>
