<h3>Workshop description</h3>
<p>Banks, insurers, big telecommunication companies and others from the old economy feel they are under the threat of the young and dynamic. Fail-fast is a system at the core of the lean startup concept designed to make you learn and grow at unbelievable speed. Allianz SE, the world&rsquo;s largest insurance company, has created an incubator to build startups and to iterate fast following the lean UX concepts. How can you design better products and services in this new era?</p>
<p>In this hands-on workshop attendees will be presented to a design challenge to be solved through the design of a mobile app. The speaker will show details on how an incubator works and innovates, the templates they use at Allianz X and provide sources of inspiration.</p>
